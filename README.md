Hello and welcome to my To-Do List Project!

I know, this may seem a bit tired, but since I have been struggling with some basics,
I have decided to practice again with a To-Do List to refresh them. This seemed like the
right project to poke around and incorporate using Vite in a fun and efficient way
(which is what Vite is all about, right?).

In this exercise I am recalling a bit of my React Hooks and Components knowledge.
